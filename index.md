### FAQ

### You are hosting Pearl Jam concerts!  Is this legitimate?

Yes!  The recordings are all recorded by the audience.  These are NOT the soundboard "bootlegs" offered for sale by Pearl Jam.  Rest assured this is all legitimate.

### Why do the shows only go back to 2013?

I'm working on uploading more shows.  There is work associated with making sure all of the songs are labelled correctly, so I'll do this when I have time.  I thought it best to get the first batch of shows uploaded.

### Can I download shows?

Soon!  I will be adding this in a future release.

### Can I help?

Maybe!  I'll post a link here soon to the repository where I'll solicit help.
